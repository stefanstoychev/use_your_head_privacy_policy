Privacy Policy for Use Your Head
Effective Date: 15.09.2025
Stefan Stoychev (“we,” “our,” or “us”) built the Use Your Head app as a memory-training tool. This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and shared when you use our app.
________________________________________
Information Collection and Use
The Use Your Head app is designed to function without requiring sensitive personal data.
•	Personal Information:
We do not collect, store, or share personal information such as your real contacts, messages, passwords, or financial details.
•	Training Data Entered by You:
You may voluntarily input dummy contact names, numbers, or codes for training exercises. This information is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us.
•	Non-Personal Information:
The app may collect anonymous usage data (e.g., feature usage, frequency of sessions) to improve functionality and user experience.
________________________________________
Data Storage and Security
•	All data remains on your device unless explicitly stated otherwise.
•	We take reasonable precautions to protect your data, but no system is 100% secure.
•	If the app uses third-party storage or analytics in the future, this policy will be updated to reflect those changes.
________________________________________
Third-Party Services
Currently, Use Your Head does not integrate with third-party services such as advertising networks, analytics providers, or social logins. If integrations are added in future versions, we will disclose them here.
________________________________________
Children’s Privacy
The app is directed to the users age of 3+. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover such data has been provided, we will take steps to delete it promptly.
________________________________________
Your Privacy Rights
•	You can clear any training data you’ve entered directly within the app.
•	Since no personal information is collected, no requests for access, deletion, or correction of personal data are necessary.
________________________________________
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and reflected by an updated “Effective Date.”
